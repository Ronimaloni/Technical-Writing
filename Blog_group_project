Concept:  Her motivation is persuading the audience to choose what they eat and be more conscious of their food and drink choices. 

Audience:   This blog has multiple audiences for each article. The main group of targets are the baby boomers and the soccer moms in the urban, and suburban environments. The authors areas of education, influence, and study are located in these areas. Thus her target audiences are in areas she can influence. 

Promotion: Her books. Alot of the articles are just pictures of the covers of her books and then details about the book. She does alot of interviews about her books. 

This all works because she can influence those in her demographics like urban areas. She can't influence farmers because they work closely with the food and its processes.
