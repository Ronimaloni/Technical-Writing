# Boer Goat Definitions

## Correct Bite  
the bottom jaw aligns up with the top dental pad.
## Parrot Mouth  
the bottom jaw is shorter than the top jaw, so that the top jaw overlaps the bottom jaw which causes an incorrect bite.
## Monkey Mouth or Mouth is Out  
the front teeth do not align up with the bottom teeth. This can also be called an over shot mouth with means the bottom jaw extend out beyond the top jaw.
## Ear 
is folded vertically from the top of the ear where it attaches to the head to the bottom, and all the way into the ear canal, in effect, nearly closing the ear.
## Neck
The juncture of the neck and shoulder should be free of excess tissue. It should gently slope to indicate muscling. Smoothness and quality are important in this area. A long clean neck with enough muscling to be in balance to the remainder of the animal is desired. A long thin neck without adequate muscling that is not in proportion to the rest of the body is not desirable. The standard changes between bucks and does, with the desirable neck in a buck having heavier muscling than the neck in a doe.
## Smooth over the Shoulder and through the Front End 
being wide and flat at the rack. The shoulder should tie in nicely to the neck, ribs, and brisket.
## Shoulders 
The goat’s muscling should increase from the withers to the point of the shoulder with the thickest muscle occurring immediately above the chest floor. The circumference of the forearm is the second most important indicator of meatiness, so the forearm muscle should exhibit a prominent bulge and should tie in deep into the knee.
## Broad through the chest floor and wide spring or sprung  
this kind of goat will have the desirable barrel with the proper shape through the ribs. The front legs will be set wide apart and not be flat at the breastbone. The rack should be wide and smooth with the ribs being round and the width should carry all the way back through the hips so that the Chest Floor is not broader than the hips.
## Lacks Volume/Depth/Capacity 
is narrow and shallow bodied. Front legs are set close together, and the hips are usually short and steep. This animal lacks room to have a large functioning rumen system, or lungs.
## Smooth over the Rack 
feels smooth over the withers and ribs.
## Slab Sided or Lacks Spring of Rib  
flat ribbed or narrow bodied – these animals lack volume/depth/capacity.
## Tracks wide from the Front/Rear 
walks straight and wide in the front and the rear.
## Short through the Hip or Rump  
lacking adequate distance between the hooks and pins. This is the overall length of  the rump.
## Steep Rumped  
too much angle between the hook and pin bones. Looks like a ski slope down from the top of the hips to the tail.
## Short through the Loin 
loin (between the 12th rib & hook bones) is too short for the size length of the goat.  Generally the back “half” of the goat (last rib to tail head) should be longer than the front half (front of chest to last rib).
## Weak/Down in the pasterns 
pasterns are weak and give when the goat walks or stands. A goat that may walk on his/her dewclaws is considered severe.
## Splays out in the front
front feet turn out when the goat stands or walks.
## Hocks In – Cow Hocked  
hocks closer together than feet, hocks bend in as viewed from the rear.  Hocks turn in when the goat stands or walks.
## Posty Leg 
The leg is straight up and down and not bent at all in the hock when the goat is standing naturally. Either knock knees or posty hocks may make it difficult for goats to walk long distances.
## Split Teat  
where two teats are so close together that they actually come out of the body on one base, and split at the end of the teat. The length of the split and presence or absence of the milk channel are determining factors whether the teats meet breed standards.
## Fish Teat 
A teat that has a small split at the tip and resembles a fish tail.
