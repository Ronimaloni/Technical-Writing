# Technical-Writing
little document for some project for work flow in college

## Current strategies
I use Microsoft Word for every document I write because it is the easiest to use out of ANY program I have been introduced to. It has:
* The most options for formatting
* Looks the neatest
* Automatically saves my documents to OneDrive
* Has autocorrect
* I dont have to guess if my words or paragraphs are going to be on one page or three. 

## Transportation and Availibility

I have flashdrives for transportation, along with uploading all my documents to OneDrive so they are accessible everywhere. If that is not an option, I email the document to myself so I am able to access it. To track changes I make to my document, I will make my rough draft and save it. Then any sequential changes will be saved in a new document titled with the title and numbers after it. 

On Microsoft Word, any mistakes that are made can be easlily remedied by pressing the back button.
