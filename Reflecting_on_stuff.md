# Readings

The chapter in the book on how to write a instructional essay was the most helpful. The other most helpful thing was the instructions on assignment 1 and 2. The other reading did not seem pertinent at all to anything we were talking about or discussing. 

The least helpful part of the readings was buying the book. We only actually used one chapter in the book. 

# One use of writing/composition other than email.

A Word document and Onedrive is one of the best forms of communication and group work. Oral communications, marketing reports, formal documents, and Post-It sticky notes are all very helpful.

# One skill

Writing concisely in your document so you can be understood in your field. 

#Final Assignment

Something that we can pass. A white paper might be interesting if you would be able to explain what it is. Something that is about 2-3 pages long. Maybe something like a news article or a product description. Maybe making a website to sell something.
